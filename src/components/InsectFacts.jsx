      fact: "Honeybees communicate through dance",
      details: "Honeybees perform a 'waggle dance' to tell other bees where to find flowers. The angle of the dance indicates direction relative to the sun, while the duration tells them how far to fly. This sophisticated communication system can direct bees to food sources miles away.",
